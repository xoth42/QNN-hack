PyTorch CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project

Implement a compact, easy-to-edit convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. This project is designed for experimentation: all sections and layers should be clearly written and demarcated to make changing the architecture simple—even for beginners.

**Project Requirements:**
1. **Model Simplicity**: Use a minimal CNN (2–3 convolutional layers, plus dense/output layers). Code for layers must be transparent, modular, and well-commented.
2. **PyTorch/Torchvision Only**: Use only standard PyTorch and torchvision utilities for dataset downloading, loading, and transforms.
3. **Visualization**: 
   - Show a selection of CIFAR-10 sample images with their true labels before training.
   - After training, plot training/validation loss curves and display final test accuracy.
4. **Project Structure**:
   - Delineate all key sections: data loading, visualization, model definition (in a `SimpleCNN` class), training loop, evaluation, and result plotting.
   - Make it easy to change the layer configuration by editing the `SimpleCNN` class only.
5. **Readability**: Include clear comments explaining each code block and design choice. Section headers are strongly encouraged.
6. **Reproducibility & Usability**: Ensure the code runs reliably on a MacBook Pro (i9, 32GB RAM) or similar machine.
7. **Reference**: Only use the following Keras-based guides for architectural or workflow ideas. All code must be written in PyTorch:

8. **Instructions**: At the top of your implementation, briefly note how to run the code and which part to edit (the `SimpleCNN` class) for changing the architecture.

**Goal:** Deliver a functional, beginner-friendly image classification starter project that can be easily extended by modifying the network architecture or experimenting with different layers.
